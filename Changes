							NetWare syslogd Daemon and Interfaces
										Changes History
===============================================================================
0. Created new project. This is our implementation of UNIX syslogd.
October 2002--Russ Bateman

1. Renamed this to syslogd.
21 November 2002--Russ Bateman

2. With version 4 of syslogd subdirectory, I am removing most of the NetWare-
like source code already written in order to try my hand at porting Christian
Hofstaedler's Open Source code.
11 June 2004--Russ Bateman

3. Discarded the new version. Christian sent me some good stuff that makes use
of what I had already written.
14 June 2004--Russ Bateman

4. (lots of files, sdk/syslog.h) Incorporated many of Christians changes plus
worked on it to get it building outside of the IDE.
14 June 2004--Russ Bateman

5. (several files) Last shuffle to get this loaded and initialized correctly.
Guess I'll check it in as a bonafide project. Now begins the real work.
14 July 2004--Russ Bateman

6. (dllmain.c, messages.c, messages.h, syslogd.c) Added Free BSD copyright
message plus code written by Christian for shutting down. Added call to this
code both in DLL_NLM_SHUTDOWN and a warning call-back registered for server
shut-down.
